pair_modify tail yes
    # assumtions and approximations:
    # 1) 3d bulk homogeneous liquid (+)
    # 2) RDF is unity beyond the cutoff
    # 3) It's computed at the begining of the run
    # 4) atoms don't feel additional energy but it's added to the PE etc

    # TODO - I would put here the sizes of H and O atoms instead of one big LJ repulsion from the O atom. What "e" to choose is still a question.
pair_coeff 2 2 0.65 3.166
    # epsilon, sigma, [LJ_Rcut, [Coul_Rcut]]
    # distance between H and O is 1.0 so 3.166 > 1.0 accounts for the size of a molecule as a whole
    # I guess the major part in forces inside a molecule are indeed due to OH and HOH (angle) bondings, so computing LJ and Coul for them would be practically a waste of time so it may be ommitted. So I see only an optimizational reason to set LJ coefs to 0 for H atoms inside a molecule. However here (as far as I understand) we set all LJ coefs to 0. I understand LJ is a short-rage potential so its contribution can be neglegible compared to Coul, but it's not obvious for me why it actually is.
    # TODO - there might be a more correct way to ommit unnecessary interaction by using special_bond

    # Is this to formaly bond atoms but actual bonding is done by rattle?

    # ? - same, how does k=0 make sense?
