    # 1) 3d bulk homogeneous liquid (+)
    # 2) RDF is unity beyond the cutoff
    # 3) It's computed at the begining of the run
    # 4) atoms don't feel additional energy but it's added to the PE etc

    # epsilon, sigma, [LJ_Rcut, [Coul_Rcut]]
    # I guess the major part in forces inside a molecule are indeed due to OH and HOH (angle) bondings, so computing LJ and Coul for them would be practically a waste of time so it may be ommitted. So I see only an optimizational reason to set LJ coefs to 0 for H atoms inside a molecule. However here (as far as I understand) we set all LJ coefs to 0. I understand LJ is a short-rage potential so its contribution can be neglegible compared to Coul, but it's not obvious for me why it actually is.
